# Majestic Media Player

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20261003_222359.png)

A dark-themed video player built on [libmpv](https://mpv.io) with a
[Silky](https://github.com/treeform/silky) immediate-mode UI, written in Nim.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arkl1te/majestic-media-player.git
cd majestic-media-player
./install.sh
```

That's it. The script installs any missing packages with `pacman` (on
CachyOS / Arch), builds the player and installs it for your user. Open the
application launcher and search for **Majestic Media Player**, or right-click a
video in Dolphin → Open With → Majestic Media Player.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./install.sh` | Build and install for the current user (`~/.local`, no root needed) |
| `./install.sh --system` | Build, then install for all users under `/usr/local` (uses `sudo`) |
| `./install.sh --uninstall` | Remove the per-user install (add `--system` for the system-wide one) |

To update, `git pull` and run `./install.sh` again.

What gets installed (`PREFIX` is `~/.local` or `/usr/local`):

- `PREFIX/bin/majestic-media-player`: the player (a single self-contained binary)
- `PREFIX/share/applications/majestic-media-player.desktop`: the launcher entry,
  which also registers the player in "Open With" for common video and audio types
- `PREFIX/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/majestic-media-player.svg`: the icon

The launcher entry points to the binary by its full path, so it starts even if
`~/.local/bin` isn't on your `PATH`. Afterwards the installer refreshes the
desktop and KDE menu caches so the entry shows up without logging out.

Files can also be passed on the command line (`majestic-media-player a.mkv`),
but that's optional. Without them it opens empty and you use File ▸ Open.

### Building manually

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed nim git base-devel mpv libx11 libxrandr kdialog
make                                   # fetches pinned deps into ./vendor, then compiles
make run                               # run from the source tree
make install                           # per-user install, same as ./install.sh
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local    # system-wide (run `make` as yourself first)
make install DESTDIR=pkgdir PREFIX=/usr  # staged install for packaging
```

`make uninstall` (with the same `PREFIX`) removes it again.

`make` prints one line per step (each dependency being cloned, then Nim's
module checking, C compilation and linking), each with the time elapsed since
the build started, a progress bar and the amount downloaded or compiled, so
finished steps stay on screen. In a terminal the current step's line and an
overall bar underneath update live; when the output is piped or logged, each
line is printed once its step is done.

`kdialog` provides the native file dialogs (`zenity` works as a fallback).
Dependencies are pinned in `deps.lock` and cloned by `tools/fetch_deps.sh`, so
builds don't depend on whatever is in `~/.nimble`.

### Windows

From Git Bash (comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)), with
[Nim](https://nim-lang.org) 2.2+ and Visual Studio or its Build Tools (C++
workload) installed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arkl1te/majestic-media-player.git
cd majestic-media-player
./install.sh
```

This fetches the pinned dependencies and a prebuilt libmpv (unpacked with
[7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)), builds `majestic-media-player.exe` and installs it
with `libmpv-2.dll` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Majestic Media Player`, plus a
Start menu shortcut. `./install.sh --uninstall` removes it again.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tools/windows.sh build` | Build `majestic-media-player.exe` in the source tree |
| `tools/windows.sh run [files]` | Build and run it |
| `tools/windows.sh debug` | Unoptimized build with stack traces |
| `tools/windows.sh install` / `uninstall` | Same as `./install.sh` / `--uninstall` |

The Run menu runs its command lines with Git for Windows' bash (set
`MMP_BASH` to use another).

## Notes

- Windowing helpers Windy lacks live in `src/xwin_x11.nim` and
  `src/xwin_win32.nim`, behind the same interface (`src/xwin.nim`).
- Windy (Silky's windowing layer) is X11-only on Linux, so the player runs
  through XWayland on a Wayland session. Window dragging, always-on-top and
  aspect-locked resizing use EWMH/ICCCM hints, which KWin honours.
- Menus are override-redirect X11 popup windows (no frame, taskbar entry or
  focus, like a toolkit's menus), so they can extend past the main window.
  They are drawn with the main window's GL context and the same Silky atlas.
- vsync is disabled on purpose: with NVIDIA under XWayland, a vsync'd
  `glXSwapBuffers` can block for seconds when the window is hidden. Video frames
  are paced from mpv's frame timing instead; the compositor prevents tearing.
- On Windows, menus are never-activated popup windows sharing the main GL
  context the same way; moving the window by the video is done by the player
  itself, so playback doesn't stall during a drag.
- Settings and recent files live in `~/.config/majestic-media-player/config.json`
  (`%APPDATA%\majestic-media-player\config.json` on Windows);
  remembered playback positions (View ▸ Options ▸ Player) in `positions.json` next to it.
- With "Same player for each media file" (the default), a running player listens
  on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/majestic-media-player.sock` and files opened from the
  file manager are handed to it instead of starting a second window. On
  Windows it listens on a loopback TCP port, written to
  `%TEMP%\majestic-media-player.sock`.
- Options ▸ Formats writes file associations to `~/.config/mimeapps.list`.
  Associations are per MIME type, so extensions that share one (mp4, m4v, f4v)
  are checked together. Unchecking removes the player from the default list,
  and the previous default takes over again. On Windows they go to the
  registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`; an app the user picked in Settings ▸
  Default apps still wins there, and the Formats page says so.
- The UI font is IBM Plex Sans (SIL Open Font License), embedded in the binary.

## Source layout

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/majestic.nim` | App state, menus, layout, panels, main loop |
| `src/player.nim` | mpv playback instance, thumbnail-preview instance, folder helpers |
| `src/videogl.nim` | mpv → texture rendering and the transformed video quad |
| `src/menutree.nim` | Menu bar / popup / context-menu system |
| `src/options.nim` | Options window (page tree and pages) |
| `src/assoc*.nim` | File associations (XDG mimeapps.list / Windows registry) |
| `src/instance.nim`, `src/peers.nim`, `src/ipc.nim` | Single-instance hand-over, Synchronize links, local sockets |
| `src/ui.nim` | Widget helpers on top of Silky's drawing primitives |
| `src/xwin*.nim`, `src/win32api.nim` | X11 / Win32 helpers (drag, on-top, aspect hints, monitors, menu popup windows) |
| `src/config.nim`, `src/dialogs*.nim`, `src/theme.nim`, `src/icons.nim` | Settings, file dialogs (kdialog/zenity, Windows common dialogs), palette, vector icons |

## Debugging

- `MMP_DEBUG=1` prints mpv's log to stderr.
- `MMP_SCRIPT` drives the UI for automated checks, e.g.
  `MMP_SCRIPT="1:open ~/v.mkv;3:menu 1;3.5:shot /tmp/view.png;4:quit"`.
  Commands: `open`, `menu <bar> [sub...]`, `ctx x y`, `close`, `mouse x y|off`,
  `overlay <name>`, `optpage <page>`, `focus <field id>`, `type <text>`, `action Menu/Sub/Item`, `fs 0|1`, `seek t`, `pause`,
  `size w h`, `set prop value`, `dump props...`, `shot file.png`, `quit`.
  `shot` also writes each open menu popup as `file-menuN.png`.
