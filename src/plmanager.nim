## The playlist manager's data: named playlists with their own entries,
## selection, playlist file and undo history, kept in playlists.json.
##
## Several players may run at once and each saves its playlists, so a save
## merges by playlist: the ones this player changed (or made, or closed) go
## in as it has them, the rest stay as the file has them, another player's
## changes included.
