# mpv turns around (play-direction) with a seek: it throws away the sound
# queued for the output and starts again from the turning point, so the
# sound jumps by the output's latency (40-65 ms) with a click, and with video
# breaks off while the decoder catches up. A turn goes to the standby
# instead. Facing the other way, it waits a little past the turning point
# (its run-up) and plays from there unheard: its sound fades in at the
# turning point, the playing player's fades out there, both placed by the
# file's time with ffmpeg's afade, so to the sample (Player.setTurnFades).
# It starts on a PipeWire cycle (21 ms or more), never quite in time, so
# while both play, how far it is from the playing player's mirror image is
# measured (Player.heardPos, to a fraction of a millisecond) and taken out
# to the sample, dropping some of its silent sound or adding silence. (A
# speed change can't: mpv filters the sound in bursts, a tenth of a second
# each, so how much it covers is anyone's guess.) At the turning point it
# takes over the picture too, as at a seamless loop's B, and the sound turns
# around there through a crossfade, in line to ~0.2 ms (recorded off a null
# sink: tmp/revsnd).
# The crossfade is as short as that allows: two mirrored copies of a sound
# partly cancel while they overlap (a dip on a steady tone).
