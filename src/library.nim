## Media libraries (the Library panel, Options > Libraries): the folders and
## files each library lists, walked for media on threads of their own into one
## index that every library reads from, their tags read afterwards.
##
## Nothing here touches a library's files on the calling (main) thread: a
## folder on a network share or a drive pulled out can block a call for
## minutes, so walking, checking that a path is there and reading tags all
## happen on worker threads, and the main thread only takes in what they post.
## A worker waiting on one call for too long is noted as not responding (its
## path says so) and another takes over the remaining work. Workers run at
## idle priority and pace themselves while something plays.
##
## Workers are started as needed and never end: Nim's allocator hands a block
## freed on another thread back to the heap of the thread that allocated it,
## which goes with that thread, and what a worker posts is freed on the main
## thread (see rgscan).
